My 11th assignment! I can see a lot of use for sets and their methods, and the flight route comparison program I made is a good example of its utility. You could also use them to check passengers against flight manifests, use it to judge completness of one set versus another known perfect set, or scour text for hits on a word filter without having to set up a loop to check each word against each white/blacklisted word. Nifty!
